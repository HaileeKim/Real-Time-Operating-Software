Real Time Operaiting System and Software

My OS environment is Ubuntu 18.04

I used while loop to process the shell continually until user intputs "exit". 

Also,commonly shell printed hostname in front of command. 

So I used "gethostname function" to get host name. 

When the shell gets command "exit", main function will return 0 to finish the shell.
